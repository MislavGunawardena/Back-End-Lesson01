# array1 contains references to 8 different string objects. In the iteration
# in line 3, those references are copied to array2. Therefore, after the each 
# statement in line 3 is executed, the corresponding elements of array1 and 
# array2 will have the same values and also they will refer to the exact same 
# objects. Hence, when objects of array1 whose values start with 'C' or 'S' are
# mutated, those changes will be visible when the relevant strings are accessed
# as elements of array2.
