# The code will print out the string 'BOB' twice in 2 seperate lines.
# The name variable and the same_name variable both refer  to the same string
# object. Line 3 mutates the string object refered to by the name variable.
# Since that is the same object that is referred by save_name, this alteration
# will be visible when we access the object referred to by save_name
