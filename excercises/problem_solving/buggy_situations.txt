If a max_by, min_by etc. method is called on an array variable, there can be
a bug in situations where the variable value is [].
This is possibly also true for methods such as each, select, and map.
This happened in problem e5.10b

If a variable value is being constructed during successive iteration through
a loop, and the variable get modified only during some of those iterations, 
based on the fulfillment of some condition, then it is very important to
update that variable during the final iteration through the loop, or right 
after the loop was exited.
This form of a bug occured in e5.10b
