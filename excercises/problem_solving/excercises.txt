1) Write a method that accepts a string and a regular expression as input
arguments and returns an array that contains the starting indices of substrings
that are returned when the .scan method is called on a string.
For example:
  if: string = 'I am 123 going $%^ home 789 tomorrow'
  then: string.scan(/[^a-zA-Z]+/) == ["123", "$%^", "789"]
the required method should return the starting indexes of substrings "123", 
"$%^", and 789.

sub_strings('I am 123 going $%^ home 789 tomorrow', /[^a-zA-Z]+/) ==
  [6, 16, 25]
