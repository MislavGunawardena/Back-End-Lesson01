* Always go for the most direct and simpler solution first even if that 
increases the size of the program, even if there are better ways of doing  
things. Refactoring can be done later.

* Execute the code, and output something ASAP. Execute the code and view the
output every time a discrete change is made to the code. It will take up more 
time, but it will save a lot more time when dubugging.

* In a method, there should be return statements only on 2 places, at the very
top, as a part of a guard clause, and at the very bottom where an implecit
return can be implemented. Otherwise it may become hard to read the method.

* Even for small problems, don't forget to extract out logic into helper
methods when that is possible. 

* Situations where logic is nested within an iteration often provide an
opportunity to extract functionality to a helper method.
