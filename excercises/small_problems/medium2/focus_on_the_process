for now,..for now.., I should focus on the process of programming rather than
trying to get as much programs done. I should not worry about the speed.
I should make sure to:

* Recheck each time I write a line of code.
* Run code every time I write a line of code.
* When running code, reason out and decide which o/p I anticipate.
* If the o/p if not what I expect, find the reason for that. Determine how
and why that o/p was displayed, and only after that make changes to the program
if that is  necessary.
* Routinely use pry to detect errors, I should rely on 'scan and think' only to
determine where I should put in binding.pry
* Don't worry too much about variable names initially. name variables for 
readability only after developing a working solution, and while refactoring the 
program for general readability.
* While I'm at all this, I should take the oportunity to develop the habit of 
using git.
