The object id's of a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, and d_outer will not change when they are initially queried from within
the method.

When the values of those variables are reassigned within the method, then their object ids will change.

When they are initialized within the method, a_inner, b_inner, c_inner, and d_inner will have the same object ids as these 
reassigned a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, and d_outer objects.

After leaving the block, a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, and d_outer will all have the same object ids that they had at the 
point at which they were passed to the method.

a_inner, b_inner, c_inner, and d-inner will all be out of scope once we leave the method. Trying to refer to those
variables will cause an error. Thus the rescue clauses will be executed.
