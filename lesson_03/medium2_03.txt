My string looks like this now: pumpkins
My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]

Calling tricky_method mutates my_array while it doesn't mutate my_string. This is because the reassignment operator +=
points the local variable a_string_param to a brand new memory location that contains a new object. While it makes use of
the object pointed to by my_string, it doesn't alter it.
On the other hand, the << operator adds an element to the array pointed to by an_array_param. This is the same array that is
pointed to by my_array.

In short: String#+= method creates a new string object. Array#<< method does not create a new object. It alters the object 
upon which it is called.
