The object id's of a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, and d_outer will not change when they are initially queried from within
the .times block. The object_id of d_outer will be the id associated with the integer object 42. Thus it will be the
same as the object if of a_outer.

When the values of those variables are reassigned within the .times block, then their object ids will change.

When they are initialized within the .times block, a_inner, b_inner, c_inner, and d_inner will have the same object ids as these 
reassigned a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, and d_outer objects.

After leving the block, a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, and d_outer will all have object ids that they aquired during the
execution of the block.

a_inner, b_inner, c_inner, and d-inner will all be out of scope once the .times block is left. Trying to refer to those
variables will cause an error. Thus the rescue clauses will be executed.
