1) [1, 2, 3]

2) It only counts those array items whose corresponding block return values return true. 

3) [1, 2, 3]
Because reject returns an array consisting of items for which the corresponding block returns false. puts always returns
nil. nil is falsy.

4) {"a"=>"ant", "b"=>"bear", "c"=>"cat"}
The hash keys will be the first letter of each word, as represented by value[0].
The hash values will be the successive values of the starting array.

5) It removes the first key-value pair from hash. It returns the removed key-value pair.

6) 11
The pop method returns :'caterpillar'. 11 is returned when .size is called on 'caterpillar'.

7) true
Both 1 and 3 satisfy the condition in the last line of the block, num.odd?
The .any? method returns true if the array on which it is called contains at least 1 item that satisfies the condition
in the last line of it's block.

8) In this example, it returns an array containing the first 2 items of arr: [1,2]
This method is not destructive. That can be verified by typing these 2 lines on irb and then examining the contents
of arr.

9) [nil, 'bear']
The first item of the hash does not satisfy the condition of the if statement in the block. Thus, the if statement returns 
nil.
The second item satisfies the condition of the if statement. Thus for the second item, the block returns: value,
which evaluates to 'bear'.
